# Data Files

This folder contains all the CSV input files needed for the timetable generator:

- `Timeslots.csv` - Available time slots (days and times)
- `Rooms.csv` - Available rooms and their capacities
- `Instructors_data.csv` - Instructor information and course qualifications
- `Groups.csv` - Student groups/sections
- `Sections.csv` - Classes/sessions that need to be scheduled
- `Timetable.csv` - Course information

These files are loaded by the timetable generator to create the constraint satisfaction problem.
